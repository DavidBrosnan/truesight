# truesight
An enumeration tool to automatically configure and call on other tools based on scan information/results.

Initially meant for automating and creating a standard methodology for CTF challenges. Truesight will allow users to define runbooks for commonly used services/tools in order to streamline the recon process.

## To-do
- Introduce OOP to clean up tool integration process
- Create more base runbooks such as ssh, dns, ftp, etc.
- Create functionality to leverage specific tools rather than an all or nothing

## Requirements
pip3 install configparser
